== about

ORLY is a nostr relay written from the ground up to be performant, low latency, and built with a number of features designed to make it well suited for

- personal relays
- small community relays
- business deployments and RaaS (Relay as a Service) with a nostr-native NWC client to allow accepting payments through NWC capable lightning nodes
- high availability clusters for reliability and/or providing a unified data set across multiple regions

ORLY uses a fast embedded link:https://github.com/hypermodeinc/badger[badger] database with a database designed for high performance querying and event storage.

On linux platforms, it uses https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1[libsecp256k1]-enabled signature and signature verification (see link:pkg/p256k/README.md[here]).
